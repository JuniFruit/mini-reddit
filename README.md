# MiniReddit - a short replica of Reddit platform
## Idea

Attempt to recreate Reddit web-site with less features. This is my implementation of Reddit platform.

## Description

This app is a copy of Reddit platform with less features. In this version I implemented post scrolling, search, communities, subscription/unsub, commenting posts, as well as share and hiding features, upvoting and downvoting from a logged in user etc.
Project features news api for several countries.

### Technologies used:
* React
* Node Express
* MongoDB
* Git
* Redux

## About Development

This project is my first attempt to create a mid-size application using React/Redux as well as database. To check the final result go [here](https://mini-reddit.onrender.com/)

* UPD 17.11.2022 project migrated to different platform
