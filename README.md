# [MiniReddit - a short replica of Reddit platform](https://mini-reddit.onrender.com/)

## Idea

Attempt to recreate Reddit web-site with less features. This is my implementation of Reddit platform.

## Description

This app is a copy of Reddit platform with less features. In this version I implemented post scrolling, search, communities, subscription/unsub, commenting posts, as well as share and hiding features, upvoting and downvoting from a logged in user etc.
Project features news api for several countries.

_It may take up to 2 minutes to load the web-page as the app is in a sleep mode, once you "wake it up" there will be no delays_

### Technologies used:
